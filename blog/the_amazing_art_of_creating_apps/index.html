<p>Fact: hackers have brilliant minds and most of times they prefer writing
their own swiss army knife application to accomplish a task.</p>

<p>Fact: I am a <em>wannabe</em> hacker and also a <em>wannabe</em> soffware developer.</p>

<p>In the last week I focused my attention in writing <a href="&#x27;https://github.com/thesp0nge/discovery&#x27;">discovery</a>
web application because I have to solve a my own task at work and because I
liked the way the app looks like now.</p>

<p>During the development, I realized that there is a lot of knowledge I don&#39;t
have and there are brilliant hackers out there.</p>

<p>Look at
<a href="&#x27;http://florianhanke.com/blog/2011/02/02/running-sinatra-inside-a-gem.html&#x27;">this</a>
blog post. It&#39;s about bundling a <a href="&#x27;http://www.sinatrarb.org&#x27;">sinatra</a>
application within a ruby gem.</p>

<p>Simply amazing. This post makes me clear I had to deploy discovery as ruby
gem and that I had to drop the CLI/Web interface dichotomy.</p>

<p>Binary tool must be a launcher for web app, no more no less. And a simple
config.ru with a require and a run statement can be enough to deploy
discovery with passenger or any rack based application server.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go ahead. I had to solve how to integrate discovery with at work active
directory repository.</p>

<p>Googling &#39;sinatra ldap active directory&#39; gives me back a lot of gems and a
lot of resources that it was embarassing choosing the appropriate one.</p>

<p>Actually, I found a three years old <a href="&#x27;http://metautonomo.us/2008/04/04/simplified-active-directory-authentication/&#x27;">blog post</a>
that shows a very simple model called ActiveDirectoryUser that solved my
problem.</p>

<p>A simple and brilliant solution I integrated in discovery with a slightly
modification. LDAP connection parameters are read from a YAML config file,
but this can become a very simple authentication framework for all web
applications I have to deploy at work without using omniauth or devise or
sinatra-ntlm or rack-or-something and this can be amazing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very creative period of my life. I don&#39;t want to waste this energy I
found looking aside pure static analysis quest I was trying to figure it out
in the last four or five years.</p>

<p>True to be told, I don&#39;t think I will ever release an out-of-the-box static
analysis tool. The main reason is that I think nobody can solve the problem
with a single &quot;catch it all&quot; application.</p>

<p>I want to stay focused in writing smallest apps solving small day by day
problem in the appsec world and I&#39;m pretty sure this would lead something
  bigger will happen when all the dots will be connect down the road.</p>
