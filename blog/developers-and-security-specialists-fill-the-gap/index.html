      <h2>Developers and security specialists: fill the gap</h2>

<p>This article will take about 2  minutes minutes to read.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the real world</h2>

<p>It&#39;s a common problem, there is a gap between developers and security
specialists. The formers only think about security in terms of firewalls and
anti-virus, the latters think about development in terms of <em>why your code
doesn&#39;t work as expected?</em> </p>

<p>The gap must be filled some way. A reason is... survival. We are all pushed to
the limits in our daytime jobs and we <strong>strongly</strong> need to address security
issues in terms of features to implement or we will face something unexpected
at the online moment.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, as a security specialist I have to know each software
development pattern and technical detail about application server
configuration, optimization and setup. And some flavour of jquery too...
<em>obviously</em>
At the other side, as developers I must care about XSS, CSRF, session fixation
and how to deal with cryptography and rainbow tables not to expose my customers
data to a confidentially mess.</p>

<p>But the truth is that this is the <em>real</em> world.</p>

<h2>assert_equal &quot;in the middle&quot;</h2>

<p>Common winsdom says that the truth is in the middle between two counterparts
opinion. Of course developers have a roadmap and appsec specialists some
internal assets to protect, but we must find a common ground to talk.</p>

<p><em>Which kind of testing frameworks do you use?</em> 
Most of times there is no answer to this question, someone nervously smiled,
someother offers you a coffee or even more they start talking about that they
sometimes make a manual navigation on the website to ensure that no 404 pages
are reached.</p>

<h2>We&#39;ve found the problem</h2>

<p>Testing must be integrated with security tests in the development stages and
testing <strong>must</strong> be automated.</p>

<p>Rspec, minitest, junit, capybara, there are a lot of testing frameworks out
there. It&#39;s not important the programming language do you use, but it&#39;s
<strong>crucial</strong> to do test and see all green lights before going further in the
development.
It&#39;s a strong statement but it must be done and checks must be provided by
security specialists and they must be used by developers.</p>

<h2>self.evangelize</h2>

<p>Use testing as common ground to talk to your developers is definitely a great
solution.</p>

<p>Next June in Milan there will be the second edition of 
<a href="http://rubyday.it">Ruby Day</a>. I submitted a talk proposal focused on this
topic. How to test for Owasp Top 10 issues using <em>TDD</em> in a ruby project. </p>
